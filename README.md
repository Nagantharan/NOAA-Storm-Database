# NOAA-Storm-Database
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

Analyzing the NOAA Storm Database
Synopsis
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database which contains events from 1950 to Nov 2011 and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. Will try to analyze & present my findings in the following areas:

Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
Introduction
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm Database. This Database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Data
The stormData for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the course web site:

There is also some documentation of the Database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

The events in the Database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the Database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.
